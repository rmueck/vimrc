# vimrc

This is my new vimrc. Trying a more minimalistic approach this time :)

- switched to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Installation

First clone the repo:

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/rmueck/vimrc ~/.vim
~~~

## Initialisation (Plugins)

Start vim (ignore errors about missing colors etc.)
Enter command mode and type `PlugInstall` 
Everything is fine now :)
